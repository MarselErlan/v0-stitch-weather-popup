## 🌤️ Check out my Stitch Weather Widget for Mac!

I made a cute desktop weather widget featuring Stitch! It shows real-time Chicago weather and the character is adorable! 💙

### 📥 Download Here:

https://github.com/MarselErlan/v0-stitch-weather-popup/releases

### 📝 Installation (Super Easy!):

1. **Download** the file called "Stitch Weather-1.0.0.dmg"
2. **Open it** and drag the app to Applications
3. **Right-click** the app in Applications and choose "Open"
4. **Click "Open"** on the security warning (only first time!)

That's it! The weather widget will appear on your screen! 🎉

### ⚠️ Important Note:

The app is not signed (costs $99/year for developer account), so you'll see a security warning on first launch. Just right-click → Open instead of double-clicking!

Enjoy! 🌺
